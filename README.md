# Linux kernel concurrency cheat sheet

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for a cheat sheet that is
suitable for printing and laminating.

Note that due to the complexity of the kernel APIs, it is impossible to
include every function and every detail. The cheat sheet is meant to be
an aid to memory and understanding, but the complete information is
better found in the code itself.
